In a chit fund application, defining clear roles is crucial for managing the interactions between users. Below is a suggested roles and permissions structure for your application, considering the requirements you’ve mentioned:

### Suggested Roles

1. **Admin**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Manage the overall application.
     - Approve user registrations and KYC documents.
     - Monitor chit fund activities and resolve disputes.
   - **Permissions**:
     - Create, read, update, and delete all user accounts and chit funds.
     - Access to analytics and reporting tools.
     - Manage settings and configurations.

2. **Chit Creator (Organizer)**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Create and manage chit funds.
     - Define the rules and terms of the chit fund (e.g., total amount, duration, number of participants).
     - Manage contributions and participant registrations.
   - **Permissions**:
     - Create and delete chit funds.
     - Update chit fund details.
     - View participants and their contributions.
     - Initiate bidding processes and select winners.

3. **Participant**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Join chit funds created by chit creators.
     - Make contributions and participate in bidding.
     - View their contributions and bid status.
   - **Permissions**:
     - Join available chit funds.
     - Make contributions.
     - Place bids in ongoing chit funds.
     - Access their account information and history.

4. **Guest**
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - View available chit funds and information.
   - **Permissions**:
     - Register for an account.
     - View chit fund details but cannot participate until registered.

### Role Hierarchy and Relationships

- **Admin**: Has the highest level of permissions, overseeing both chit creators and participants.
- **Chit Creator**: Can create and manage multiple chit funds, and can view participants who join those funds.
- **Participant**: Can join multiple chit funds but does not have administrative privileges over chit fund management.
- **Guest**: Can become a participant by registering.

### Example Workflow

1. **User Registration**: A guest registers as a participant.
2. **Chit Creation**: An authorized chit creator logs in and creates a chit fund, specifying rules and participant limits.
3. **Joining a Chit Fund**: Participants can view and join any active chit funds created by chit creators.
4. **Contributions and Bidding**: Participants make contributions and can place bids based on the chit fund rules.
5. **Admin Oversight**: Admin monitors all activities, ensuring compliance and resolving issues as necessary.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC in your backend to ensure that each role can only perform actions permitted for that role.
- **User Profiles**: Store role information in user profiles to manage permissions dynamically.
- **UI Adjustments**: The frontend should display different options and functionalities based on the logged-in user’s role.
